									<h3 align="left" class="major">Identification of Material-types from Large Mineralogical, Geomechanical and Geochemical Datasets using Unsupervised Machine Learning</h3>
										<p></p>
										<a align="justify" href="#" class="image"><img src="images/geomet.png" alt="" height="420" width="750"/></a>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify"> <strong>Summary:</strong> At various stages in the life of a mineral deposit, a collection of data is generated by drilling, and this information can be fed into large databases. The various data collected could include mineral compositions, the presence of alterations, and geomechanical properties. However, not all these cores can be analyzed in detail, and only certain sections of the drill core will be subjected to more extensive and expensive processing. These tests could provide a more detailed characterization of the different types of ore behaviour (i.e., comminution or recovery). The objective of this research is to identify from these large databases different material domains, i.e., groups of samples with similar properties. This provides a deeper comprehension of the factors that are driving mine and mill performance at any stage of the mining cycle, leveraging a maximum of information from the data collected from the drillholes. This research generates a robust and systematic workflow that allows the collected core samples to be grouped into sets of meaningful material domains via the use of up-to-date dimension reduction algorithms and the implementation of a novel density-based clustering algorithm created specifically for this application.</p>

										<p></p>
										<p align="justify"> <strong>Summary:</strong> The objective is to classify image data of the Fashion-MNIST dataset through multiple-layer perceptron (MLP). The image dataset is vectorized and normalized before model training. Seven MLPs are designed
											with different settings and structures. Besides, a PyTorch Convolutional neural network (CNN) is also used as a comparison.
											In addition, a tuned MLP architecture is proposed to optimize the performance at its best.</p>

										<a href="#" class="image"><img src="images/welzl.png" alt="" height="420" width="750"/></a>
										<p></p>
										<p align="justify"> <strong>Summary:</strong> Safety is a primary consideration in underground mining operations. Accidents could result in fatalities, injuries, as well as considerable financial and reputational losses to the mining company. As an underground mine consists of many workspaces distributed in various zones, the selection of junction locations in the network could be significant for timely evacuation of miners from different areas. This research project proposes a methodology to determine the optimal location of a junction point minimizing the maximum evacuation distance of the miners, and thus this geometric optimization is formulated as a MiniMax problem. The solver developed is based on the Welzl algorithm. The method is fully implemented in Python, and its functionality is demonstrated by conducting various case studies in 2D and 3D mining drifts networks.  </p>

										<p></p>
										<p align="justify"> <strong>Summary:</strong> The main task of this study is to implement two supervised machine learning models known as Logistic Regression (LR) and Multiclass Regression (MR) to perform classification predictions for textual data (IMDB Reviews and 20 newsgroup). The datasets are first cleaned and trimmed to reduce the number of features to be included in the train and test datasets. The objective is to keep the most representative words to increase the prediction accuracy. Then, the developed models are trained and used for class prediction in the test dataset.</p>
